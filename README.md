<p><em>I developed these codes as part of a course on <strong>Udemy</strong>, where I learned Tensorflow <strong>(CNN, NLP, RNN, BERT, Feature Extraction, Fine tuning)</strong> in a professional and structured manner. This repository basically explains my learning journey of Tensorflow and adventures into Neural Networks. The hands-on experience gained from the course has been instrumental in enhancing my understanding of deep learning concepts and their practical applications.</em></p>
